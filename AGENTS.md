# typeship — agent context

This package is the generated TypeScript SDK for **typeship** (v0.3.0).

Generate production SDKs, CLIs, and MCP servers from an OpenAPI or
GraphQL spec, and keep every selected output current.

Every operation but one requires an API key, created in the console and
sent as `Authorization: Bearer ak_...`. A browser session is not a
credential for this API. The exception is POST /generate, which works
anonymously with the free plan's limits.

## Ground rules
- Generated code: never edit files in this package by hand — changes are lost on regeneration. Wrap the client in your own code instead.
- Zero runtime dependencies; everything runs on platform `fetch` (Node 18+, browsers, edge).
- `api.md` in this package is the complete method reference: every operation, parameter, and error class. Read it before guessing.

## Authentication
- Bearer token: `TYPESHIP_TOKEN` env var, or the `bearerToken` client option.

## Using the SDK
```ts
import { TypeshipClient } from "typeship-ax";
const client = new TypeshipClient({ /* auth options above */ });
```
- Every call returns `ApiResult<T, E>`: check `result.ok`, or `unwrap(result)` to throw the typed error. Nothing throws on HTTP errors by default.
- Paginated methods return a `PagePromise`: `for await (const item of client.x.list())` walks every page.
- Every method takes a last `{ timeoutMs, maxRetries, headers, signal }` argument for per-call overrides; every result carries `response: { status, headers, requestId }`.
- Uploads take a `Blob` (a `File` for a filename).
- `debug: true` (or a function) on the client logs one redacted line per request.

## Documentation
- The reference for this exact package: `api.md` (offline, always current with the code).
- Conceptual guides live on the docs site. For questions about how the API's concepts fit together (flows, ordering, environments), fetch `https://typeship.dev/llms-full.txt` and read the relevant sections; `https://typeship.dev/llms.txt` is the page index.
